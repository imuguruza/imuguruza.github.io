# About me

I am a robotics engineer, focused into hardware, who is enthusiastic about electronic design (PCBs), robotic and embedded fields -Linux running uPs, microcontrollers, FPGAs and hybrid FPGA-uP architectures-, [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) and open-source software/hardware in general. I am also keen on the field where the hardware and software worlds merge, such as Linux kernel or drivers, even though it can be a nightmare :-) Apart from technology, I am also a big cycling, hiking, swimming and traveling lover.

I consider myself a multidisciplinary engineer, I am able to design complex hardware pieces (such as the [H-ROS SoM](https://acutronicrobotics.com/technology/som/)) or make hardware debugging using oscilloscope, work with Linux  kernel to adapt and patch it, add new device tree entries, bootstrap hardware using u-boot or vendor bootloaders, make small Linux drivers and ROS nodes and many more things.

I am a proud former member of **Erle Robotics** and **[Acutronic Robotics](https://acutronicrobotics.com/)**, where both companies where pushing the boundaries of Linux-based drones and modular robotics using open source tools. I was involved in them since the beginning, allowing me to have a good intuition of the nowadays robotics landscape.

I have been also involved in [micro-ROS](https://micro-ros.github.io/), an approach to put ROS 2 into microcontrollers, working as consortium member into hardware related tasks.

Always curious and eager to learn more from robotics, a field where mechanics, electronics and software are blended together. I consider it one of the most challenging and promising fields out there!
