# About me

I am a hardware engineer who is enthusiastic about electronic design (PCBs), embedded world -Linux running uPs, microcontrollers, FPGAs and hibrid FPGA-uP architectures-, open-source software/hardware in general. Apart from technology, I am also a big cycling, hiking, swimming and traveling lover.
