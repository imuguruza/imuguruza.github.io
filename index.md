# About me

I am a hardware engineer who is enthusiastic, in overall, about hardware design and embedded system development: electronic design (PCBs), robotics and [ROS](https://www.ros.org/), Linux running uPs, microcontrollers, FPGAs and hybrid FPGA-uP architectures, and, of course, open-source software/hardware in general.

Lately, I find very interesting the hybrid computing architectures for speeding up data processing and computation tasks based on hardware accelerators (implemented in FPGAs) for robotics, multimedia and autonomous technology, such us autonomous cars.

Apart from technology, I am also a big sport (cycling, hiking and swimming/surfing) nature/hiking and traveling lover.

I consider myself a multidisciplinary engineer, I am able to design complex hardware pieces (such as the [H-ROS SoM](https://web.archive.org/web/20190811152810/https://acutronicrobotics.com/technology/som/files/som-system-on-module-datasheet-v1.pdf)) or make hardware debugging using oscilloscope, work with Linux kernel to configure it, add new device tree entries, bootstrap hardware using u-boot or vendor bootloaders, make small Linux drivers and ROS nodes and many more things.

I am a proud former member of [Erle Robotics](http://archive.vn/3DZr4) and [Acutronic Robotics](https://web.archive.org/web/20190807210800/https://acutronicrobotics.com/), where both companies where pushing the boundaries of Linux-based drones and modular robotics using open source tools. I was involved in them since the beginning, allowing me to have a good intuition of the nowadays robotics landscape. I was also involved in [micro-ROS](https://micro-ros.github.io/), an approach to put ROS 2 into microcontrollers, working as consortium member into hardware related tasks.

Currently, I work at [Ikerlan](https://www.ikerlan.es/), a basque R&D company, developing innovative technology and products for our customers.

In my spare time, I am trying to focus on getting FPGA-design knowledge -from hardware design to digital logic-  using novel tools, mainly open-source ones.

I am always curious and eager to learn more about hardware design, ROS2, FPGAs and Linux! I hope I can blend this technologies in personal projects and in my professional career :-)
