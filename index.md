# About me

I am a hardware engineer who is enthusiastic about electronic design (PCBs), robotic and embedded fields -Linux running uPs, microcontrollers, FPGAs and hybrid FPGA-uP architectures-, [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) and open-source software/hardware in general. I am also keen on the field where the hardware and software worlds merge, such as Linux kernel or drivers, even though it can be a nightmare :-)

Lately, I find very interesting hybrid computing architectures for speeding up data processing, based on hardware accelerators (mainly FPGAs) for robotics and autonomous technology, such us autonomous cars.

Apart from technology, I am also a big cycling, hiking, swimming and traveling lover.

I consider myself a multidisciplinary engineer, I am able to design complex hardware pieces (such as the [H-ROS SoM](https://web.archive.org/web/20190811152810/https://acutronicrobotics.com/technology/som/files/som-system-on-module-datasheet-v1.pdf)) or make hardware debugging using oscilloscope, work with Linux  kernel to adapt and patch it, add new device tree entries, bootstrap hardware using u-boot or vendor bootloaders, make small Linux drivers and ROS nodes and many more things.

I am a proud former member of [Erle Robotics](http://archive.vn/3DZr4) and [Acutronic Robotics](https://web.archive.org/web/20190807210800/https://acutronicrobotics.com/), where both companies where pushing the boundaries of Linux-based drones and modular robotics using open source tools. I was involved in them since the beginning, allowing me to have a good intuition of the nowadays robotics landscape. I was also involved in [micro-ROS](https://micro-ros.github.io/), an approach to put ROS 2 into microcontrollers, working as consortium member into hardware related tasks.

Nowadays I work at [Ikerlan](https://www.ikerlan.es/), a basque R&D company, developing innovative technology and products for our customers.

Always curious and eager to learn more from robotics, a field where mechanics, electronics and software are blended together. I consider it one of the most challenging and promising fields out there!
